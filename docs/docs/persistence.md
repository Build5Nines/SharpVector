# Data Persistence

The `Build5Nines.SharpVector` library provides easy-to-use methods for saving a memory-based vector database to a file or stream and loading it again later. This is particularly useful for caching indexed content between runs, deploying pre-built vector stores, or shipping databases with your application.

## File Persistence

`Build5Nines.SharpVector` supports persisting the vector database to a file.

!!! info
    This functionality is implemented as methods available to both the `Build5Nines.SharpVector.BasicMemoryVectorDatabase` and `Build5Nines.SharpVector.OpenAI.BasicOpenAIMemoryVectorDatabase`. These methods are actually extensions on the base `IVectorDatabase` interface, so all implementations of this interface will have this capability.

### Save to File

To persist your `BasicMemoryVectorDatabase` to disk, use the `SaveToFile` or `SaveToFileAsync` methods:

```csharp
var vdb = new BasicMemoryVectorDatabase();

var filePath = "vectordata.b59vdb";

// persist vector database to file asynchronously
await vdb.SaveToFileAsync(filePath);

// -- or --

// persist vector database to file
vdb.SaveToFile(filePath);
```

!!! info
    The file extension used in this example is `.b59vdb`, however this is arbitrary. The library doesn't look at the file extenions. It only reads the binary contents of the file; which is actually in ZIP file format.

### Load from File

To load a previously saved vector database from disk, use the `LoadFromFile` or `LoadFromFileAsync` methods:

```csharp
var vdb = new BasicMemoryVectorDatabase();

var filePath = "vectordata.b59vdb";

// load vector database from file
vdb.LoadFromFile(filePath);

// -- or --

// load vector database from file asynchronously
await vdb.LoadFromFileAsync(filePath);
```

## Persist to Stream

The underlying methods used by `SaveToFile` and `LoadFromFile` methods for serializing the vector database to a `Stream` are available to use directly. This provides support for reading/writing to `MemoryStream` (or other streams) if the vector database needs to be persisted to something other than the local file system.

!!! info
    These `SerializeToBinaryStream` and `DeserializeFromBinaryStream` methods are available in `v2.0.2` and later.

### Write to Stream

To persist your `BasicMemoryVectorDatabase` to a JSON stream, use the `SerializeToBinaryStream` or `SerializeToBinaryStreamAsync` methods:

```csharp
var vdb = new BasicMemoryVectorDatabase();

var stream = new MemoryStream();

// serialize to JSON stream
vdb.SerializeToBinaryStream(stream);

// -- or --

// serialize asynchronously to JSON stream
await vdb.SerializeToBinaryStreamAsync(stream);
```

### Read from Stream

To load your `BasicMemoryVectorDatabase` from JSON stream, use the `DeserializeFromBinaryStream` and `DeserializeFromBinaryStreamAsync` methods:

```csharp
// Be sure Stream position is at the start
stream.Position = 0;

// deserialize from JSON stream
vdb.DeserializeFromBinaryStream(stream);

// -- or ---

// deserialize asynchronously from JSON stream
await vdb.DeserializeFromBinaryStreamAsync(stream);
```

## Sample Console App

The sample console app in this repo show example usage of `Build5Nines.SharpVector`.

It loads a list of movie titles and descriptions from a JSON file, then allows the user to type in prompts to search the database and return the best matches.

Here's a screenshot of the test console app running:

## Generative AI + RAG + ONNX Model

This example takes a [ONNX](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/get-started/with-csharp.html) Generative AI app and extends it to implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using `Build5Nines.SharpVector`.

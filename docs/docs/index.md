# Build5Nines.SharpVector

**SharpVector** is a lightweight, in-memory text vector database built for .NET applications. It enables fast and flexible vector-based similarity search for text data ‚Äî ideal for search engines, recommendation systems, semantic analysis, and AI-enhanced features.

Vector databases are used with [Generative AI](https://build5nines.com/what-is-generative-ai/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sharpvector) solutions augmenting the LLM (Large Language Model) with the ability to load additional context data with the AI prompt using the [RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)](https://build5nines.com/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sharpvector) design pattern.

While there are lots of large databases that can be used to build Vector Databases (like Azure CosmosDB, PostgreSQL w/ pgvector, Azure AI Search, Elasticsearch, and more), there are not many options for a lightweight vector database that can be embedded into any .NET application. Build5Nines SharpVector is the lightweight in-memory Text Vector Database for use in any .NET application that you're looking for!

> "For the in-memory vector database, we're using Build5Nines.SharpVector, an excellent open-source project by Chris Pietschmann. SharpVector makes it easy to store and retrieve vectorized data, making it an ideal choice for our sample RAG implementation."

## üöÄ Key Features

- üîç **Text Embedding & Search** ‚Äì Store and search documents using vector similarity (cosine, Euclidean, etc.)
- üß† **Pluggable Embeddings** ‚Äì Works with your own vectorizer (like OpenAI, HuggingFace, or custom)
- ‚ö° **In-Memory Performance** ‚Äì Designed for speed in local or embedded applications
- üõ†Ô∏è **Lightweight & Easy to Use** ‚Äì Minimal dependencies, simple API
- üì¶ **Custom Metadata** - Store additional metadata with each text entry stored in the vector database.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Supports async/await** - Async methods for scalable and non-blocking database operations.
- ‚ö° **Vector Comparisons** - Supports various vector comparison methods for searching similar texts. Including cosine similarity (by default), and configurable for Euclidean distance. Or write your own custom vector comparison algorithm.

## üß† Use Cases

An in-memory vector databases like `Build5Nines.SharpVector` provides several advantages over a traditional vector database server, particularly in scenarios that might demand high performance, low latency, and efficient resource usage.

SharpVector is great for:

- Embedding search within desktop or server .NET applications

- Building semantic search over documents or notes

- Powering recommendation features based on text similarity

- Integrating with OpenAI or local embeddings for intelligent querying

- Offline or Edge computing with limited or no internet connectivity

- Development and testing without the overhead of installing a server

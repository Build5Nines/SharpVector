# Build5Nines.SharpVector

**Build5Nines.SharpVector** is the lightweight, in-memory, semantic search, text vector database built for .NET applications. It enables fast and flexible vector-based similarity search for text data ‚Äî ideal for search engines, recommendation systems, semantic analysis, and AI-enhanced features.

Vector databases are used with [Generative AI](https://build5nines.com/what-is-generative-ai/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sharpvector) solutions augmenting the LLM (Large Language Model) with the ability to load additional context data with the AI prompt using the [RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)](https://build5nines.com/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sharpvector) design pattern.

While there are lots of large databases that can be used to build Vector Databases (like Azure CosmosDB, PostgreSQL w/ pgvector, Azure AI Search, Elasticsearch, and more), there are not many options for a lightweight vector database that can be embedded into any .NET application. Build5Nines SharpVector is the lightweight in-memory Text Vector Database for use in any .NET application that you're looking for!

## Basic Usage

Here's a really simple usage of creating a vector database, adding some text to it, then performing a semantic search on the data.

```csharp
using Build5Nines.SharpVector;

// Create new vector database
var vdb = new BasicMemoryVectorDatabase();

// Get text to vectorize
string[] texts = LoadMultipleTexts();
// Define metadata to store alongside the text vectors
var metadata = "custom metadata";

// Add multiple texts with metadata to vector database
foreach(var t in texts)
{
    // vectorize the text
    vdb.AddText(t, metadata);
}

// Perform semantic search using Cosine Similarity search on the text vectors in the database
var result = vdb.Search("Build5Nines.SharpVector is awesome!");

// Loop through search results
foreach(var item in results.Texts)
{
    var itemText = item.Text;
    var itemMetadata = item.Metadata;

    // do something with the semantic search results
}
```

## üß† Use Cases

An in-memory vector databases like `Build5Nines.SharpVector` provides several advantages over a traditional vector database server, particularly in scenarios that might demand high performance, low latency, and efficient resource usage.

SharpVector is great for:

- Building semantic search over documents or notes

- Embedding search within desktop or server .NET applications

- Powering recommendation features based on text similarity

- Integrating with OpenAI or local embeddings for intelligent querying

- Offline or Edge computing with limited or no internet connectivity

- Development and testing without the overhead of installing a server

## Local, OpenAI, or Ollama Embeddings Generation

`Build5Nines.SharpVector` includes a local text vectorizer to generate embeddings for text added to the database. This is automatic and eliminates external LLM server dependencies. However, both [OpenAI Embeddings](embeddings/openai/index.md) and [Ollama Embeddings](embeddings/ollama/index.md) are also supported for more robust and higher quality embeddings support.

Build5Nines.SharpVector is a simple, small, easy to embed, in-memory Vector Database for use in any .NET application.

The `Build5Nines.SharpVector.BasicMemoryVectorDatabase` class uses a Bag of Words vectorization strategy, with Cosine similarity, a dictionary vocabulary store, and a basic text preprocessor.

### Example Usage

```csharp
    // Create a Vector Database with metadata of type string
    var vdb = new BasicMemoryVectorDatabase();
    // The Metadata is declared using generics, so you can store whatever data you need there.

    // Load Vector Database with some sample text data
    // Text is the movie description, and Metadata is the movie title with release year in this example
    vdb.AddText("Iron Man (2008) is a Marvel Studios action, adventure, and sci-fi movie about Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), a billionaire inventor and weapons developer who is kidnapped by terrorists and forced to build a weapon. Instead, Tony uses his ingenuity to build a high-tech suit of armor and escape, becoming the superhero Iron Man. He then returns to the United States to refine the suit and use it to fight crime and terrorism.", "Iron Man (2008)");
    vdb.AddText("The Lion King is a 1994 Disney animated film about a young lion cub named Simba who is the heir to the throne of an African savanna.", "The Lion King (1994)");

    // Perform a Vector Search
    var result = vdb.Search(newPrompt, pageCount: 5); // return the first 5 results

    if (result.HasResults)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Similar Text Found:");
        foreach (var item in result.Texts)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(item.Metadata);
            Console.WriteLine(item.Text);
        }
